# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
Social Media websites have evolved to become a source of varied kind of
information. This is due to nature of microblogs on which people post real time
messages about their opinions on a variety of topics, discuss current issues,
complain, and express positive sentiment for products they use in daily life.
In fact, companies manufacturing such products have started to poll these
microblogs to get a sense of general sentiment for their product. Many times
these companies study user reactions and reply to users on microblogs. One
challenge is to build technology to detect and summarize an overall sentiment.
In the project, we would use Twitter and build models for classifying “tweets”
into positive and negative sentiment. Our project will show that features that
have to do with Twitter-specific features (hashtags) add value to the
classifier but only marginally. Features that combine prior polarity of words
with their parts-of-speech tags are most important for both the classification
tasks. Thus, we see that standard natural language processing tools are useful
even in a genre which is quite different from the genre on which they were
trained (newswire). We use manually annotated movie reviews corpus of NLTK for
our experiments. An overview to our project is to train the machine with the
movie review data set to classify the tweets into positive and negative classes
by plotting a graph based on the sentimental analysis of twitter feeds.
